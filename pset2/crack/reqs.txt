Requirements:
Your program should accept one and only one command-line argument: a hashed password.
If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should print an error (of your choice) and exit immediately, with main returning 1 (thereby signifying an error).
Otherwise, your program must proceed to crack the given password, ideally as quickly as possible, ultimately printing the password in the clear followed by \n, nothing more, nothing less, with main returning 0.
Assume that each password has been hashed with Câ€™s DES-based (not MD5-based) crypt function.
Assume that each password is no longer than five (5) characters. Gasp!
Assume that each password is composed entirely of alphabetical characters (uppercase and/or lowercase).
